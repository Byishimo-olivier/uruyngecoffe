            <h3>INFORMATION FOR Karongi CONSUMERS</h3>
            <p>This part of the document integrates with and supplements the information contained in the rest of the privacy policy and is provided by the business running Ururyange and, if the case may be, its parent, subsidiaries and affiliates (for the purposes of this section referred to collectively as “we”, “us”, “our”).</p>
            <p>The provisions contained in this section apply to all Users who are consumers residing in the state of California, United States of America, according to "The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018" (Users are referred to below, simply as “you”, “your”, “yours”), and, for such consumers, these provisions supersede any other possibly divergent or conflicting provisions contained in the privacy policy.</p>
            <p>This part of the document uses the term “personal information“ as it is defined in The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).</p>

            <h3>Categories of personal information collected, disclosed or sold</h3>
            <p>In this section we summarize the categories of personal information that we've collected, disclosed or sold and the purposes thereof. You can read about these activities in detail in the section titled “Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data” within this document.</p>

            <h3>Information we collect: the categories of personal information we collect</h3>
            <p>We have collected the following categories of personal information about you: identifiers, commercial information and internet information.</p>
            <p>We will not collect additional categories of personal information without notifying you.</p>

            <h3>How we collect information: what are the sources of the personal information we collect?</h3>
            <p>We collect the above mentioned categories of personal information, either directly or indirectly, from you when you use Ururyange.</p>
            <p>For example, you directly provide your personal information when you submit requests via any forms on Ururyange. You also provide personal information indirectly when you navigate Ururyange, as personal information about you is automatically observed and collected. Finally, we may collect your personal information from third parties that work with us in connection with the Service or with the functioning of Ururyange and features thereof.</p>

            <h3>How we use the information we collect: sharing and disclosing of your personal information with third parties for a business purpose</h3>
            <p>We may disclose the personal information we collect about you to a third party for business purposes. In this case, we enter a written agreement with such third party that requires the recipient to both keep the personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose(s) other than those necessary for the performance of the agreement.</p>

            <h3>Sale of your personal information</h3>
            <p>For our purposes, the word “sale” means any “selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic means, a consumer's personal information by the business to another business or a third party, for monetary or other valuable consideration”.</p>
            <p>This means that, for example, a sale can happen whenever an application runs ads, or makes statistical analyses on the traffic or views, or simply because it uses tools such as social network plugins and the like.</p>

            <h3>Your right to opt out of the sale of personal information</h3>
            <p>You have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal information. This means that whenever you request us to stop selling your data, we will abide by your request.
